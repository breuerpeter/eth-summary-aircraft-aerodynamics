Equations in highlightboxes are the fundamental equations of a section that are used to derive the equations in mathboxes.

If an equation in a mathbox requires a fundamental equation from a different section, that equation is referenced over the equal sign.

If equations are applicable only under certain conditions and used certain assumptions, these are listed before the equations. These conditions/assumptions apply to all equations that follow and are in the same parent box. If an equation requires an (additional) assumption, then this is given over the (approximately) equal sign in the mathbox of that equation.

If an equation in a mathbox is based on a different mathbox equation (in the same section i.e. box), make sure the latter precedes it.
